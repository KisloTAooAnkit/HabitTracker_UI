# Contributing

## General
These are general guidelines when contributing to the project. These guidelines should help contributors understand which branch and how to structure these commits. 

### Branch Policy

 | Branch name | Description. |
|---|:--|
 | **main** |  After testing and reviewing merge conflicts the code will be merged into main. Before code can be merged into master it will go through a QA process. |
 | **Creating a branch** |  When creating a branch include the following: a description of the task and the issue ID e.g. _add-coredata-module-1337_. Hyphens should be used to seperate words. |

### Pull Requests
When contributing to the project there are some clear guidelines to follow:

**1. State the intent of the PR**

State the intent of the pull request by using a meaningful description.

**2. Clearly describe what has changed**

Clearly describe the changes that have been made e.g.

> Refactored legacy code

❌ This does not describe what has changed, but rather sums up the ticket

> Refactored View X by removing unuseful comments and added factory methods to handle... _additional detail_

✅ This highlights the core changes and provides further detail to changes

**3. Add screenshots where necessary**

Sometimes front end UI changes may require screenshots. Use these at your leisure. 

### Issue resolution

All contributors are encouraged to add tickets where necessary. There are some boilerplate templates for bugs and features. Should you want to add a feature please run this past the project maintainers. 

There are two types of templates for issues:
1. Bug - an error
2. Feature - a set of functionality or enhancements
